	   This is a seminar course for students in the Masters in Applied Economics and Finance degree program at UCSC. Seminars occur once a week on Thursdays and attendance is mandatory. There are no assignments or exams and the course grade is determined entirely by attendance. The objective of the seminar series is to teach professional development topics, such as resume and cover letter preparation and developing an impactful online profile, as well as to provide exposure to industry professionals who work in the areas of applied economics and finance.

	   Since the course grade is determined entirely by attendance, students are required to attend each seminar and record their presence on a sign-in sheet. Signing the sheet for another student who does not attend the seminar is considered a violation of the UCSC academic integrity standard and will be penalized with course failure. As unforseen circumstances may arise that cause a student to miss a seminar, each student is allowed one (explained) absence during the quarter. Thus, attending 9 out of 10 seminars during the quarter is considered passing, provided that the single absence is explained.
